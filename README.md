Link Theory is an original theoretical framework developed and authored by [Your Name or "El Kaye"] that explores how psychological trauma propagates through the human brain—not just biochemically, but structurally.

Rooted in network neuroscience, graph theory, topology, and trauma psychology, Link Theory proposes that neural collapse follows geometric logic. Specifically, it centers on triangle motifs—the smallest fully connected units in a network—as the brain’s fundamental structures of resilience. When these motifs break down, stress cascades across the system, triggering emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms often observed in trauma.

This repository contains the initial implementation of Link Theory simulations, offering:

A full-length paper explaining the theory, its mathematical foundations, and neuroscience grounding

Python notebooks for simulating structural failure, EEG-informed stress propagation, and 3D motif-based collapse

Visualizations of stress flow, motif collapse, geodesic dome propagation, and recovery logic

Modular code designed for replication, further research, and applied exploration

This project is entirely original and continues to evolve. The simulations presented here represent Phase I of development: building structural logic, mapping failure, and connecting empirical EEG markers to theoretical vulnerability. Ongoing work includes:

Advanced failure modeling using real-time EEG data

Integration of trauma-specific symptom cascades (e.g. dissociation, hypervigilance)

Comparative modeling between healthy and trauma-exposed connectomes

Development of potential repair and recovery algorithms within the motif framework

If you're an academic, researcher, clinician, or systems designer interested in the intersection of trauma and geometry, this project is open for review, feedback, and collaboration.

This is not just a model of breakdown. It's a structural blueprint for understanding how the brain tries to hold.
