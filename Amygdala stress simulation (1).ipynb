Starting with a signal strength of 100, the region is exposed to stress over a series of cycles, losing 15 units of signal strength per cycle. Once the signal drops below 40, the system identifies it as structurally at risk and outputs a warning. The simulation uses a simple for loop and conditional if statement to demonstrate threshold-based failure in a localized node. This forms the foundational logic for more complex models of stress propagation and motif-level compensation in neural networks."],"metadata":{"id":"-H08fxGbu-Ny"}}]}
